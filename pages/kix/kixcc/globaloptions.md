#### Global options

Whereas the other programs of the KIX family include the possibility to customise the outcome to be displayed in the **Results** panel by using the Global option menu, this feature is not available for KIX-CC.

#### Alias commands

The KIX-CC plug-in is based on Excel add-ins which were first available in German language. Hence, some commands have older German abbreviations. In order to ease the migration from the Excel add-ins to the KIX-CC plug-in, the older commands are still available as aliases.

The following table gives an overview of the alias commands:

Command | Alias 
---|---
$\text{CLI.CC}$ | $\text{KIXCC}$ 
$\text{CTG.CC}$ | $\text{WBGCC}$
$\text{IV-2012}$ | $\text{Q4/2012}$
