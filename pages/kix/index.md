As opposed to fixed-base indices, aggregating chain-linked index series is anything but trivial. Yet some of the most prominent macroeconomic indicators, such as national accounts or harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP), are constructed as chain-linked Laspeyres indices. Furthermore, the currently developed "indices of exchange rate effects in the international investment position (IIE)" are part of this index family.

The necessary computational work for chain-linked indices can be facilitated by using programs of the KIX family. The abbreviation KIX of KettenIndeX is the German word for chain index. The software JDemetra+ (JD+) provides the implementation of KIX plug-ins.


## Installation

Download the installation file from the plug-in's GitHub repository and save it to your local folder of choice. Choose

$$\text{Tools} \rhd \text{Plugins}$$

from the JD+ drop down menu, open the **Downloaded** sheet and press the **Add Plugins** button. Select the local copy of the installation file, click the **Install** button and accept the terms in the licence agreements. Once the installation is finished, KIX documents and a global option menu are available. Note that the plug-in is automatically activated and, therefore, a restart of JD+ is not necessary.
